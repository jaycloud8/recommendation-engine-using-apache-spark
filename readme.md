# Recommendation Engine

A recommendation engine can make predictions for unknown user-item associations based on known user-item association.

User-item association is user's affinity to item.

Recommendation engine builds a prediction model based on known user-item associations (Training data) 
and then make predictions for unknown user-item associations (Test Data).

## Collaborative Filtering Technique
Collaborative Filtering based recommender engines use matrix factorization model typically 
(Alternating Least Square method) to fill the missing entries of user-item association. 

Item ratings are influenced by a set of factors, such as userâ€™s choices and interests, called Latent Factors.

More the latent factors, better will be the predictions.

The standard approach to matrix factorization based collaborative filtering treats the entries 
in the user-item matrix as `explicit preferences` given by the user to the item, for example, 
users giving ratings to movies.

It is common in many real-world use cases to only have access to `implicit feedback` 
(e.g. views, clicks, purchases, likes, shares etc.).

In the following example, we load ratings data from the MovieLens dataset, 
each row consisting of a user, a movie, a rating and a timestamp. 
We then train an ALS model which assumes, by default, that the ratings are explicit (implicitPrefs is false). 
We evaluate the recommendation model by measuring the `root-mean-square error` of rating prediction.
